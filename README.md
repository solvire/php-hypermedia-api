## Hypermedia API 

This work originally started trying to bring the LeadFerret front-end user API into compliance. 

## Not REST API

We wanted to do something RESTful but we found that pretty much every implementation was not REST.  Meaning it didn't comply with the initial intention of the Roy Fielding who coined the term. It is very rare to find a web service that actually does that.  Instead of trying to pretend we decided just to write the hypermedia part.
